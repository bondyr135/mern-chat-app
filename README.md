how fun.

## Why?
To add a mern-stack project to my portfolio, and have a try with `Socket.io`.<br>Keep fingers in shape, sharpen skills, expand knowledge. Punch the sun.

## How? 
Using the known mern-stack: `mongoDB`, `Express.js`, `React` and `Node.js`. as well as:
* `Socket.io `
* `Styled components`
* `mongoose`
* `cors`
* `React-router`
* `axios`
* ans some `React hooks`

## How to run?
If you really feel the need...:
1. Download project
2. Navigate with command line into `server` folder and `npm install` dependencies<br>
2.1 Repeat `npm install` inside the `public` folder

**Note: ** a database *must* be installed and running for this app to run and work.

3.  Inside `/server/index.js` change `process.env.MONGO_URL` (inside mongoose connecting funtion) to appropriate address
4. Using the command line once inside the `server` folder, once inside the `public`, run `npm start`
5. Enjoy with your favorite toppings
